Full-stack Airline Management System (React + Spring Boot, Microservices) for check-in, in-flight & ancillary services.

ISSUES:
-> MODIFY PassengerInflightDTO to return fields "selectedAncillaryIds": "List<Long>",
  "selectedMealId": "Long (optional)",
  "selectedShoppingItemIds": "List<Long>"
}

-> Are there delete endpoints for in flgiht services?

-> Return from post request can be made error free?
