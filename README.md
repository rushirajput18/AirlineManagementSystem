Full-stack Airline Management System (React + Spring Boot, Microservices) for check-in, in-flight & ancillary services.

### Issues:
- Endpoint `/staff/flights/{flightId}/passengers` -> need more data fields from the endpoint fetch result like passenger name, optional fields(address, passport, dob)
- Changes to UI and seat check in functionality as mentioned yesterday
- In flight service ui changes
- What to do about check in service (backedn vs frontend)
